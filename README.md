🎭 Emotion Detection from Urdu Speech

This project implements a transformer-based model for classifying emotions in Urdu speech with 94.5% accuracy. 
By leveraging a large-scale dataset and state-of-the-art transformer models, we surpass previous benchmarks in Urdu speech emotion recognition.

📂 Dataset
- We created a custom dataset by combining audio from three different datasets, with the largest being the SEMOUR+ dataset. This unique dataset set our work apart from previous research in the field.

🧠 Models Tested
We experimented with six different models for emotion classification:

- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- ResNet50
- HuBERT
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
- Wav2Vec2.0 (Best Performing Model: Achieved 94.5% Accuracy)

🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy & Pandas
- Transformers (Hugging Face)

🚀 Features
