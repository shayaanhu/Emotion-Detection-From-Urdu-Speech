ðŸŽ­ Emotion Detection from Urdu Speech

This project implements a transformer-based model for classifying emotions in Urdu speech with 94.5% accuracy. 
By leveraging a large-scale dataset and state-of-the-art transformer models, we surpass previous benchmarks in Urdu speech emotion recognition.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- We created a custom dataset by combining audio from three different datasets, with the largest being the SEMOUR+ dataset. This unique dataset set our work apart from previous research in the field.
